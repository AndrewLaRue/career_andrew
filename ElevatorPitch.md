<!-- 5 steps for an elevator pitch -->

1- Intro 
  <!-- optional sentence with my name / One sentence about who i am -->
My name is Andrew LaRue.

I'm seeking an entry level software developing job that will make use of the skills I learned at Codeworks, as well as my attention to detail and strong work ethic.  




2- Explain what you do
  <!-- Two sentences about highlighting what problems i can solve, abilities i have -->
As a teen, I was fascinated with computers and would spend hours changing settings and swapping out hardware on my parents old desktop in an effort to improve its performance.

I have since gained experience with several software languages including Html, JavaScript, Vue.js, Node.js and C#..  I've also worked with and designed both MySql and NoSql databases.





3- Identify who you serve
  <!-- 1-2 sentences on why i want to work there/ be a software dev in general. -->
As a young father, I chose to put my interest in computers on hold and focus on providing for my growing family.  Once I reached a point in my life where I could focus less on survival, I found myself returning to the digital landscape and a growing passion for software development.




4- What makes me different(uvp)

I enjoy problem solving and building projects of all kinds.  Whether thats building an app, redesigning a website, creating bio-active enclosures, restoring classic cars or even creating custom furniture.

I look forward to seeing what I could offer to your company and building on my knowledge of the digital world.
